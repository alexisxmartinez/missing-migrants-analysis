- Description: Contains records of migrant deaths and disappearances reported worldwide.

## Project Goals
- Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
- Identify trends, patterns, and insights related to migrant deaths and disappearances.
- Create visualizations to communicate the findings effectively.
- [Optional] Implement predictive models to forecast future incidents.

## Data Dictionary
*(Optional for now, can be populated when you understand the dataset more)*

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository using `git clone [your-repo-url]`.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed, with necessary packages like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, etc.
3.  Install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt` *(we will generate this file later)*
4. Place the dataset in the root folder called 'data'
5. Run the notebook with 'jupyter notebook'
